<h1>Kindle Screensaver</h1>
<p>Something that I've wanted to do for a while is create an "electronic photo frame", partially because I haven't gotten around to sorting my photos for printing, and partially just because its cool, with the basic idea being that I would either send the kindle images over wifi, or store the images within the kindle and have them rotate around. I was also inspired by seeing a friend find a way to "print" content onto a kindle screen through wifi, but after looking into it the kindle needed to be on to "print" content onto it, which is both power inefficient and just kinda annoying.<br>
So after researching a little I found the best way would be to do two things: install a screensaver hack (the key difference is that the kindle displays screensavers without being "on"), and SSH into the kindle to send it commands over wifi to rotate through the images.<br>
Hacking the kindle itself was a fairly simple process, more complicated than hacks I've done on other devices like my Vita or 3DS mind, but I only really got stuck on one part of the installation where you had it in demo mode, and you needed to press the screen a specific way to break out, nothing that a youtube video couldn't help though</p>

<p>With the base hack installed, the process then is to install new modules, namely the Screensaver hack and USBNetwork module, as you can probably guess, one of them allows you to add custom screensavers, and the other allows you to connect your kindle to the your PC's network. While this was supposed to be the simplest part now that the base hack was done with, I ended up having to reinstall both once or twice each before they were working. I focused on the connecting to the network first, while a little finneky, I installed the correct drivers, gave the kindle a static ip on my PC's network, and intalled PuTTY to SSH into the kindle.<br>
I connected to the kindle, and I need to login to the root in order to send the refresh command, I entered to login as 'root' and it gave a nice "Welcome to Kindle!" message before asking for a password, luckily for me there is a nifty <a href="https://www.sven.de/kindle/">Kindle root password tool</a> where you can enter your serial number in to get a root password. Easy right? I mean they just give us the password.<br>
I start entering in the passwords, starting with 'mario' which is supposed to be a universal root password. "Access denied". No matter there's three left... "Access denied" "Access denied" "Access denied"...</p>

<p>To be honest I was at a loss of words, I checked my serial number, and the four passwords, but everything was correct, searching online was no help too as you needed ssh access in order to reset the password.<br>
This was extremely disheartening to be honest as the one method I could think of to get this working has collapsed in front of me. And I wish I could say there was a happier end to this but I still haven't found a way to get in<br>
If there is a postive note to end on I got the custom screensavers to work without issue...</p>
