<h1>Codes and Cryptography</h1>
I'm going to be honest, for most of my life I have never been much interested in cybersecurity, I've seen it mentioned but my idea of cybersecurity was in the style of Mr Robot and hacking; but as I've gone deeper into computer science, and particularly learning about Alan Turing's work on the enigma machine, my interest started to pique, finalised by a number of people posting links to different cryptography courses in the my university's computer science discord server. After looking through them I figured the <a href="https://cryptopals.com/">cryptopals challenges</a> would be a fantastic way to start learning<br>
as I don't have much experience even set 1 of the challenges wasn't the easiest for me, lots of new things to learn and consider, especially in how to make effective use of functions. But the first few challenges were as follows: converting hexadecimal to base 64 (and back), doing a binary XOR, and the first stumbling block: finding a single-character key from an encrypted message<br>
This took me longer than I'd like to admit, partially because of the lack of direction in how to devise a "scoring" method, and was ultimatly unable to figure it out by myself, resorting to a guide, but only really to take the formula they used to find the best key<br>
Thus after a fair bit of experimenting, I was able to find the one translateable line from a text file 360 encrypted lines long, I was proper chuffed with myself to say the least, I have also been told that the decrypted lines are Vanilla Ice lyrics, which is... interesting to say the least<br>
And finally I'm currently working on the repeating key XOR, which is the challenge where they say that if you can complete this challenge, you've be good to complete 75% of the content in the challenge list. So this challenge is one where we have a key of length 2-40 characters long. I'm making decent headway on this, with splitting up the characters, and finding the keys, I just need to put the finishing touches on and it should be working (I hope), so check back on this space soon for updates!
